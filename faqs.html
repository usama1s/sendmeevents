      <h2>
        What is Event Me all about?
      </h2>
      <p>
        You may be tempted to compare SendMeEvents to the events
        announcements in your newspaper or city magazine, but the difference
        is that instead of event organizers advertising their events, it is
        you who "advertises" yourself to get invited to events that you are
        interested in. The only thing you have to do is to describe your
        event preferences and your general interests, and organizers of
        interesting events can find and invite you. You benefit because
        event organizers can create events more targeted to your preferences,
        other attendees will be more compatible with you than at random
        events, and you don't miss events, because instead of having to
        search for them, you actually get invited.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What about my privacy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Because we don't have your name and address, we can't expose it to
        anyone. And we never give out your email address. Instead, we forward
        the invitations to you on behalf of event organizers. Similarly,
        we use your account information only for matching; none of this
        information will ever be revealed to people other than you.
        Please review our <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a> for details.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some event organizers may ask you for some information about you when
        you RSVP for their events. For this, they might use Event Me's online
        rsvp system.
        However, Event Me never combines this information with your account.
        We encourage you to ask event organizers questions about their privacy
        policy and what they are going to do with information that you give to
        them.
      </p>

      <h2>
        How do I register?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Simply go to <a href="subscribe.html"> Subscribe</a> page and start by providing some
        rather
        general information. Using this, we will then present you with
        questions that we will keep as
        relevant to you as possible. You can complete this personalized process or
        terminate early. In either case you will get to your "My preferences" page
        where you'll get an overview of all your information and from where you can
        access areas of your event preferences that you have not edited yet. You can
        always reach your "My preferences" page by logging into www.EventMe.com
        and make desired changes. To login, you need your email address
        registered with us and your password, both of which we will also
        email you to confirm your registration.
      </p>

      <h2>
        How do I unsubscribe?
      </h2>
      <p>
        If you want to delete your subscriber account, simply email
        <a href="mailto:invite@SendMeEvents.com">invite@SendMeEvents.com</a>
        with "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the subject line.
        Or you can log in to your account and follow the link to
        "unsubscribe" on the "My preferences page". You can also find
        this personalized link in the footer of all our invitation and
        calendar emails.
      </p>


      <h2>
        What's up with your unsubscribing of inactive subscribers?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Every two months or so, we email Subscribers who have not opened any of
         our emails, clicked on any of the links, nor logged into their online
         account for some time. Simply clicking a provided link and/or logging
         in at www.SendMeEvents.com
        signals us to keep the corresponding account active. We unsubscribe all
        accounts that still have shown no activity about two weeks later.
        <br>
        <br>
        We do this so that we don't clog email inboxes of Subscribers who are
        no longer interested in our emails without them having to do anything.
         Many ISPs who handle your email (like Yahoo!, AOL, Hotmail, etc.) also
         notice that only a small
        number of our emails is left unread. This helps them in deciding to put
        our emails in your inbox and not into your junk/spam folder.
        <br>
        <br>
        Unfortunately, we can't always know whether our emails are being
        read - only if you get our html emails and allow their images to be
         shown we can tell whether you open them. Therefore, you might find
         yourself included in such an
        unsubscription effort even if you are a regular reader of our emails.
        Getting the html version of our emails and allowing images to be
        shown will keep your account protected.
      </p>

      <h2>
        How can I get invited to more events?
      </h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>
            The simplest way to get invited to more events is to select more
            activities. Generally speaking, the more preferred activities you
             have selected, the more
            invitations you will get.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
            Because many events are of interest only to subscribers with special
            interests or particular demographic backgrounds, it is a good idea
             to provide much of this information, too. For example, you will
             only get invited to a some networking
            events in your industry if you've specified your field(s) of work,
            and you will only get invited to some charity events if you have
            specified your advocacy interests. This general information is also
            essential to help ensure that we are
            inviting a group of people with compatible interests to the same event.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
            You can vastly increase the number of invitations you receive by
            providing additional postal/zip codes indicating approximate areas
            in which you would go to events. For example, you might be working
             in a different city or neighborhood than
            you are living in or travel regularly to a different city and/or
            country.
            </span>

          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
            All the preferences you list that refer to events in general
            (e.g., smoking policies) are already set as defaults so that
            you are most likely to get invited to events that match your
            activity preferences. By being more explicit and stating
            selective preferences, you'll get invited less often to events
            that don't match those
            preferences.
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>
        How do I change my password?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Login at SendMeEvents and click on "Change my password."
      </p>

      <h2>
        How do I change my email address?
      </h2>
      <p>

      <h2>
        Where does Event Me promote events?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Event Me can work anywhere in the world, but it is still a very young
        service and is most active in the New York metropolitan area. We also
        have a rapidly growing number of subscribers and events in Boston,
        Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami,
        Philadelphia, Portland, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and
         Washington, D.C. and expect to see other cities becoming active soon.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Why can't I just browse a list of events in my area and choose for myself?
      </h2>
      <p>
        You should still look to your daily newspaper or preferred city guide
        for events that run on a regular schedule, like movies and theaters.
        As a matter of fact, we also publish a lists of upcoming public events
        (see links in the footer of our
        site for your city). However, it can get tedious to browse through
         endless listings of events, only a few of which appeal to you. And
         since it is impossible to search all listings on a regular basis,
         you often miss out on interesting events.
        By using Event Me, you actually receive personalized invitations to
        events that have already been preselected to match your interests.
        <br>
        <br>
        Also, even our calendar of public events doesn't list many of the
        events our subscribers get invited to: Many event organizers do not
        use public listings at all for their events but instead invite specially
         selected individuals. SendMeEvents
        allows you to be one of the special invitees without being on hundreds
        of "A-lists".
        <br>
        <br>
        You can also find the list of upcoming events that you have been
        invited to in your "My events" section that you can reach after
        logging in. This can come in handy if you can't find the email
        invitation anymore or you want to get an overview
        of all your invitations.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What happens when I'm "invited" to an event?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Each time we promote an event organizer's event, we have compared
        it with as much of your information as possible. You have to have
         both stated your interest in the planned type of event and match
         the event organizer's expectations about his
        or her target audience in order for us to send you the invitation
        on behalf of the organizer.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Can my friends join me for an event I am invited to?
      </h2>
      <p>
        In most cases, the event organizer won't mind if you forward his
        or her invitation to your friends if you believe that they are
        interested in the event. You will also be welcome to RSVP for or
        simply show up with your friends. However, some
        event organizers will request in their invitation that you don't
        forward the invitation and/or bring friends with you. Please do
        not disregard their wishes. You can always encourage your friends
        to join Event Me themselves to avoid getting
        tired of always forwarding invitations to them.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Do I have to pay for this service?
      </h2>
      <p>
        No. Subscribers use Event Me for free. You can also list your
        event free of charge in our calendar. However, organizers pay
        a fee for dedicated mailings of their
        invitations.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Can I promote events through Event Me?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Anybody can promote an event through SendMeEvents. You can find
        more information <a href="post_an_event.html"> here</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What can I do to make Event Me better?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for asking! We greatly appreciate you subscribing to our
        service. The more subscribers we can reach, the more relevant we
        become to the organizers in your community. That in turn enables
        us to tell you about more diverse local
        events that matter to you. Besides <a href="tell_a_friend.html"> telling your friends
          about us</a> you can help us by linking to our site from your website,
          social media sites, or blog (if you have one). If you know of a
          great event, tell the organizer to get
        it listed on Event Me, for free. And don't forget to tell your
        friends in the media world about us!
